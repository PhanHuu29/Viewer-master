# Multi Monitor Service

The multi-monitor service provides detection, launch and communication support
for multiple monitors or windows/screens within a single monitor.



## GUI Behaviour

Double click study in study browser => set as active study for current screen and apply hanging protocol as
active study

(later)
Right click study in study browser => brings up menu to select as prior, or apply specific HP

Two modes
  - independent left/right windows
    - launch studies on left/right windows
    - each applies own hanging protocol on "active" study for that window

(later)
  - coordinated hanging protocol
    - determined by hanging protocol
    - coordinates mixed studies
    - applies full hanging protocol, but sub-selects it for specific screen

(later)
Single "launch" button for launching to other screen
